* About

Just a few personal extras I am using/testing currently. In other words, WIP, nothing to see.


* lex             - like let* but uses plist-like syntax of pairs
* lex-if          - like if-let*   (uses lex under the hood)
* lex-when    - like when-let* (uses lex under the hood)
* rtimes        - like dotimes, but only repeat count
* while          - simple while-loop as in elisp
* while*         - multiple condition while loop with named conditions
* named-let   - recursively called let with named conditions
* import-from - shadowing-import via slightly more convenient syntax
* defun          - declare elisp-style ignored lambda-list arguments
